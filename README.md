# Classification-of-News-DS303-
This repository contains files related to our course project in the course DS303. We built a model that distinguishes fake news articles from legitimate ones. 

# Uses of the project
Such classifiers will play a crucial role in these times of social media where everything spreads like wild fire and causes unnecessary panic among people. While the governments and courts of several countries are taking actions against media companies for aiding the spread of fake news, these programs have become a necessity for all companies. 

# How the project functions
Speaking in layman's language, these models digest a huge dataset that contains both true and fake news articles and then train their algorithms to distinguish between them. 
In our project, we used an open source dataset from kaggle that contained a set of news articles already labelled as true and fake. We cleaned the data to make it suitable for training our algorithm. And then used the multinomial naive bayes theorem to develop a model that can predict if a news article is true or not.

# How interested people can make a similar model
Those interested can start by first going through our model and giving an attempt at understanding what we have done. Several comments that have been added in the project are very important if someone wants to easily comprehend the method. The person should be familiar with the Naive Bayes theorem or he/she might face difficulites in analysing our work. Although they can make a model from alternate algorithms which they are comfortable with. There are a plethora of other algorithms that can be found on the internet and will be helpful in making a similar project. However, one advantage of using Naive Bayes is that it gives a high accuracy even with a small amount of training data.
